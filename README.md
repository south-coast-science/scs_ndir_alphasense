# scs_ndir_alphasense
Environmental sampling abstractions for the Alphasense IRC-A1 NDIR CO2 Transmitter board.

_South Coast Science is currently developing an SPI interface board for the Alphasense IRC-A1 NDIR sensor. The SPI 
board is intended to replace the Alphasense IRC-A1 NDIR USB Transmitter board in most applications. This code is
no longer supported, but is provided to users who need to develop their own USB solution._

_See **[scs_ndir](https://github.com/south-coast-science/scs_ndir)** for more information._

**Required libraries:** 

* Third party: pyserial
* SCS root: scs_core
* SCS host: scs_host_bbe or scs_host_rpi
